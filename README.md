# Google News Headline Analysis
Final project for UCSD's COGS 18 class, Introduction to Python.

This project analyzes of Google News headlines of the day. It collects headlines using the requests library and utilizes BeautifulSoup to parse HTML. Finally, it visualizes the most commonly occurring words using a bar graph (via matplotlib.pyplot library) and wordclouds (via wordcloud library).

Data visualization is done in the Jupyter Notebook, ProjectNotebook.ipynb, which uses functions in my_module/functions.py to parse and preprocess the headlines. You can view an example (using headlines from June 12, 2019) on the current notebook. Clone this repo and re-run the notebook to try out the data visualizations with the headlines of the day!
